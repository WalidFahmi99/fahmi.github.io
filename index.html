        <p>Thank you for being a wonderful part of my life. As we step into the new year, I hope to chat with you again and create more beautiful memories together.</p>
        <p>Wishing you love, joy, and success in the coming year.</p>
        <p>I'm always here waiting for you forever, I always think about you, when will you unblock me. believe that I will always love you forever</p>
        <p>I always wait for good news from you</p>
        <p>How are you here? I always think about you, whether we can go back to the way it was before, Sahira</p>
        <p>When you read this message later, I hope you won't be angry because this is my complaint for the last few months, 
            and I apologize to you because I couldn't obey your orders to forget you. This is about the heart and feelings of someone who first knows what love and affection are. 
            I'm always comfortable chatting with you, maybe you think it's normal, but believe me, it means a lot to me, even if it's a very small thing. That's why I want to be serious with you,
             I went to St Klender Baru hoping to meet you, Sahira. but everything was beyond my expectations, you didn't come there I fell into despair but what happened was I loved you more and more, 
             I hope next time I can meet you. I also realized that I was ugly, I didn't deserve you, I only had sincerity and loyalty to you, I was always there for you whenever you needed me.</p>
        <p>With all my love,</p>
